    <h2>Shaneisia Bailey</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm Shaneisia Bailey. I am a 21 year old past student of the Westwood High School, who hails from Golden Grove in the beautiful parish of St. Ann. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the <a href = "https://www.mona.uwi.edu/" target="_blank">University of the West Indies</a>. I like to read novels, listen to music and talk about current affairs with friends and family. I am interested in Web Development because I feel like it is a really interesting area of technology and it is really fun to learn. I love seeing how web developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other programming languages and scripting languages to express their creativity and make websites that are absolutely spectacular. I want to be able to that too. I hope to one day be able to make creative and interactive websites like this one <a href="https://www.adeolaadeoti.xyz/">this</a>, <a href="https://kenjimmy.me/">this</a>, and I could only dream of being able to make a website like <a href="https://jesse-zhou.com/">this</a>. I am hoping that this course will be a huge stepping stone on my journey to being a successful Software Engineer and Web Developer. </p>
